* finish compiler so that it is complient with translator

* add functionality on compiler to take session_id data from signature_data file into compiled file

* create 'uploader' that takes the data from compiler and uploads it to BB machine
should have different functionality for new signatures and existing ones (if sessionId=0 it's new)
new signatures should be uploaded then imported for the sessionId
existing should be uploaded using the sessionId

* create 'icyget' and 'icyset' macros to download and transform to icy, and compile and upload from icy

* add dynamic field support

down the road
* create VSCODE syntax highlighting

* make installation guide

probably never implement:
* saveto file_repository
* add site support
