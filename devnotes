* add macro icyopen which allows for fuzzy searching and opening in vim icy scripts from icy dir

* add jumping variables, local to icy, allowing for dynamic jumps

* add macro to show line numbers

* add multiline condition support for translator and compiler

* add check to compare icyget'ed signature vs existing, and notify is same, rather than asking if to overwrite

* allow creation of empty signatures using Wset/icyset. currently throws an error

* fix bug where if you have "L cd %%DBL%%" followed by a new line, the compiler will throw an error while Wset'ing

* refractor translator and compiler parsing to allow more flexable lines ( 0 or more empty lines between lines, multi line condition and waitfors)

* add '||' and '&&' as counterparts to 'OR' and 'AND'

* add icy specific comments

* add dynamic field support

* add remediation support

* add 'ignore timeout' or 'extend timeout to 60 and 30 for both types' for icyget command

down the road
* create VSCODE syntax highlighting

* make installation guide

* changing icy file name doesn't affect signature map, the tracking should insue, either by session_id and id or by signature name

probably never implement:
* saveto file_repository
* add site support
