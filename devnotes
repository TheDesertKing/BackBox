* create 'uploader' that takes the data from compiler and uploads it to BB machine
-insert product selection from /intelliChecks/signatures/options/in into optionsForSignature field ("optionsForSignature" is always null from getAllIntelliChecks call)
same for sessionDynamicFields,tags
compensate for yet-to-be-parsed fields used when uploading:
	accessRestriction:"predefined"
	
* add multiline condition support for translator and compiler

* add dynamic field support

* add remediation support

down the road
* create VSCODE syntax highlighting

* make installation guide

probably never implement:
* saveto file_repository
* add site support
