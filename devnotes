* create 'uploader' that takes the data from compiler and uploads it to BB machine
should have different functionality for new signatures and existing ones (if sessionId=0 it's new)
add functionality on uploader to take session_id and id from signature_data.map file into compiled file
new signatures should be uploaded then imported for the sessionId
existing should be uploaded using the sessionId

-complete icyget.py
-create alias icyget
create icyset.py
create alias icyset
