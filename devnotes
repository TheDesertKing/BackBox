* add multiline condition support for translator and compiler

* add '||' and '&&' as counterparts to 'OR' and 'AND'

* add dynamic field support

* add remediation support

* add 'ignore timeout' or 'extend timeout to 60 and 30 for both types' for icyget command

down the road
* create VSCODE syntax highlighting

* make installation guide

* changing icy file name doesn't affect signature map, the tracking should insue, either by session_id and id or by signature name

probably never implement:
* saveto file_repository
* add site support
