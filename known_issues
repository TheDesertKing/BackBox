*Can't use redirect in shell command if it's at the end like so:
cat abc > file
as it would compile to BackBox's saveto filename

*Cant write 'if(' as start of command like so:
R if(something something) >> abc
The compiler will confuse it as being a condition

*Wait_for messages are not read and are set empty by compiler and translator

No representation of saving to file_repository

*Can't compile a single quote in status
